Shiny App: Household Electricity Consumption by Dwelling Types (2013)
========================================================
author: Zhen Xiong, Lim

Motivation
========================================================

Why create this app?

- To visualise the electricity consumption patterns for households in Singapore
- To understand if "richer" households consume more electricity and how much more (assume bigger house equals richer) 
- To see if electricity consumption varies with time of the year

The App
========================================================

Features of the app:
- created using Shiny and can be viewed here: (https://zhenxiong.shinyapps.io/App-1)
- drop-down menu for selecting different dwelling types (6 options)
- checkbox for textOutput and color change


Observations
========================================================

From the visualisation, it was observed:

- electricity usage increased with bigger, wealthier dwelling types (of course!)
- landed properties consumed almost 6 times more electricity than 1-room flats
- 1-room and 2-room flats as well as landed properties had the least variation in electricity consumption across the year, while other dwelling types showed obvious variations in consumption pattern, where consumption peaked around May - Aug (hot season in Singapore).


Hypothesis
========================================================
Most wealthy households are insensitive to price of electricity and would maintain electricity consumption throughout the year regardless of e.g. hot/ cold weather while less wealthy households could be more conscious of spendings and hence minimised electricity consumption consistently.
